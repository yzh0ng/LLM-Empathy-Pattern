"I cheated on my ex and I feel terrible. I betrayed and broke her trust. And now what’s worse is that she’s gonna have trust issues with any other guy she meets because of ME. I don’t even know why I did what I did but I want to find out. Our relationship was going well, she made me happy. Every time I texted her I would get butterflies. She made me the happiest I’ve ever been. I thought I loved her, but how can I do this to someone I love? Maybe I didn’t love her? But I thought I did? This whole situation has gotten me self reflecting on my actions and I think I’m going to see a therapist. I don’t want any future relationship to go through this ever again. I need to fix myself. I miss her so much, but I don’t deserve her. She deserves better. I hope the next guy that comes along treats her better than I did.
Since the breakup, I’ve been looking at past photos and videos of us. It made me sad. It feels like I lost my best friend. You know what’s funny? My dad cheated on my mom and I told myself that I would never want anyone to go through that pain. But look at me, I’m a hypocrite. I always preached staying loyal to your significant other but I failed. I failed at being not only her bf, but best friend. I don’t even know why I’m sad when I’M the one that hurt her.",Cheat,"Thank you for sharing this—it takes a lot of courage to be this honest, especially when you're sitting with such heavy emotions. It's clear that you deeply regret what happened and that you genuinely cared for your ex. The fact that you're reflecting, asking hard questions, and considering therapy shows a powerful desire to grow. Sometimes, we act out in ways that don't align with our values, not because we’re bad people, but because there are parts of us that are unhealed or unexplored. Wanting to understand why you did it is an important step toward making sure it never happens again.
It’s okay to feel grief—you lost someone important, and even if it was your mistake, your pain is still real. Acknowledging that doesn’t excuse what happened, but it does give you space to begin healing. You’re not alone in this. You made a mistake, yes—but you’re also taking accountability. That matters. Keep going.","Your post shows a lot of self-awareness and genuine remorse, which is an important first step in healing and growth. It’s clear you’re carrying a heavy burden of guilt, and while what happened hurt your ex, it’s okay to acknowledge your own pain too. You’re human, and humans make mistakes—even ones they swore they’d never repeat. The fact that you’re reflecting so deeply and considering therapy shows real courage and a desire to change. It’s understandable to feel like you don’t deserve her or even your own sadness, but your emotions are valid. You lost someone important to you, and grief doesn’t discriminate based on who was ""at fault."" Therapy can help you unpack why this happened and how to rebuild trust in yourself moving forward. You’re not doomed to repeat this pattern. Growth is possible, and your willingness to confront this speaks volumes. Be kind to yourself as you work through this. Healing isn’t linear, but you’re taking the right steps. You deserve forgiveness, too—especially from yourself.","Thank you for sharing something so difficult and personal. It's clear you're experiencing deep remorse and self-reflection after betraying someone you cared about deeply.
The fact that you're questioning your actions and seeking to understand why this happened shows genuine growth. Recognizing patterns (like your father's behavior) that may have influenced you is insightful, and your decision to seek therapy is a positive step toward healing and preventing similar mistakes.
It's natural to feel sadness even though you caused the hurt—relationships are complex, and we can genuinely miss someone while acknowledging we harmed them. Your pain doesn't invalidate your responsibility, but it does show you understand the significance of what was lost.
Your recognition that she deserves better demonstrates empathy and accountability. Rather than focusing only on your loss, you're considering her healing journey too.
This difficult experience can become transformative if you commit to the personal work ahead. The self-awareness you're showing is the foundation for becoming someone who honors commitments and treats others with the respect they deserve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/11jvhdf/i_cheated_on_my_ex_and_feel_terrible/
"I (M35) recently cheated on my partner (F30) of 10 years. Nothing physical, but lots of messages were exchanged. Many of them were sexual in nature.
I feel physically sick typing those words. I can't believe what I've done to her. I've upended her entire life.
The worst part is - we were both so happy. I was planning to propose. We had a home together, a dog. Everything was great. And I've lost everything because of that. We had so much fun. We laughed every single day. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that she was my ""soul mate"".
I've never cheated on her, or anyone else before. I can't believe that I let myself do this. How can I have been so stupid?
The moment I sat her down and said what I'd done I saw her heart break in front of me. I've spent 10 years trying to make her feel so happy and loved and looked after. I hate myself for being the one who has caused the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this much pain.
How can I begin to get through this? I've never felt so terrible about everything. The one person who I'd want by my side while I feel like this is gone forever, and it's entirely my fault.",Cheat,"Thank you for opening up—this kind of honesty is incredibly painful, but also incredibly important. What you're going through right now is full of grief, guilt, and heartbreak, and it's okay to sit with those feelings, as overwhelming as they are. You made a mistake, a deeply hurtful one, and you're owning that. That accountability matters—it’s the foundation for healing and growth, even if it doesn’t take away the hurt right now.
It’s clear how much you loved her and still do. You’re not minimizing what happened, and you’re not running from the pain you caused. That speaks to your character, even in this moment of failure. We all carry contradictions—loving someone deeply and still making choices that hurt them. That doesn’t excuse what happened, but it can be a starting point for understanding yourself more fully.
Be gentle with yourself as you move through this. Therapy, reflection, and time can help. Healing won’t be fast, but it is possible—even if the relationship doesn’t recover, you still can.","Your pain and regret are so clear in your words, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid. It takes courage to admit what you’ve done and to face the consequences, especially when you deeply love the person you’ve hurt. The guilt and self-hatred you’re feeling right now are overwhelming, and it’s okay to sit with those emotions—they’re part of recognizing the gravity of your actions. It’s important to acknowledge that healing, whether individually or together, will take time. Right now, your partner’s pain is the priority. If she’s open to it, couples therapy might help both of you process this, but respect her need for space if that’s what she chooses. For yourself, consider individual therapy to explore why this happened and how to rebuild trust—in yourself and, if possible, with her. You’re not defined by this mistake, but growth starts with accountability. Be patient with yourself and her. Whether or not reconciliation is possible, learning from this will help you move forward with integrity. You’re not alone in this pain—reach out for support when you need it.","Thank you for being so open about what you're going through. The pain and regret in your words are palpable, and it's clear you're grappling with the devastating consequences of your actions.
It's particularly difficult when there was so much good in your relationship. The contrast between the life you had built together and the current reality must feel overwhelming. The fact that you immediately owned up to what happened shows character, even though it resulted in witnessing her heartbreak firsthand.
Right now, you're likely experiencing a storm of grief, shame, and self-hatred. These feelings are natural, but please remember that making a terrible mistake doesn't make you a terrible person. We all have the capacity to act in ways that contradict our values and intentions.
Moving forward will take time. Focus on understanding why this happened, perhaps with professional support. Practice self-compassion alongside accountability. While your relationship may be over, your capacity for growth isn't.
The road ahead will be difficult, but many have walked it before you and found healing. Be patient with yourself as you navigate this painful process.RetryClaude can make mistakes.

"I know cheating isn't a topic we should tolerate or normalize but I have been living in this sorrow for too long because I cannot seem to find the power to forgive myself and I beat myself up thinking that I do not deserve another chance in love/romance. Even I couldn't believe that I was capable of doing such a thing.
I only cheated on her with one person and I got caught. Is it normal to be in this rut, this feeling of guilt, this feeling of regret for 2 years approaching 3 now? Every waking hour of my day, I am full of sorrow that I've hurt the love of my life and it takes everything in me to call her and ask for a 2nd chance.
Now, my ex is doing fine. She got into a new relationship a few months after we broke up, she's moved on from the pain I caused her, she's travelling a lot now, she passed her nursing board exam (NCLEX) and she's generally doing fine without me. Me and her are emotionally polar opposites at this point. I know this because we still follow each other on social media.
My friends tell me that it's time for me to move on and just learn from it but somehow for the life of me cannot move on and I do not know why. I do not know how to move on nor am I actively trying because I feel like I do not deserve to be forgiven. This whole thing has such great hold over me and I am more unstable than the radiation levels in Chernobyl.
Should I seek therapy for feeling this way after 2-3 years or am I just overthinking it?",Cheat,"What you're feeling isn’t overthinking—it’s a deep emotional wound that hasn’t been given the space or tools it needs to heal. Living with guilt for this long can feel like you're trapped in a loop of regret and self-punishment, and that’s not something you just “snap out of.” You’re not weak for struggling to move on. You’re human. You made a mistake—one that clearly goes against your own values—and it’s haunted you. That kind of inner conflict can be devastating.
Therapy could absolutely help, not because you’re broken, but because you deserve support while working through this pain. A therapist can help you unpack what happened, explore why you're stuck, and most importantly, help you learn to forgive yourself. Your ex moving on doesn’t invalidate your feelings, but it might be a sign that you can allow yourself to start healing too. Self-forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting or excusing—it means acknowledging your wrongs while still believing you’re worthy of growth and love. You are.","Your pain and guilt are deeply valid, and it’s clear how much this experience has weighed on you. Carrying this regret for years shows how deeply you care about the harm caused, and that speaks to your capacity for growth. It’s okay to acknowledge that you made a mistake—what matters now is how you move forward with that awareness. The fact that your ex has moved on doesn’t mean you’re obligated to stay stuck. Healing isn’t about deserving forgiveness; it’s about learning to live with your past without letting it define your future. Your friends are right in urging you to move forward, but it’s also okay if you need help to get there. Therapy could be incredibly valuable—not because you’re ""overthinking,"" but because this guilt has held you captive for too long. A therapist can help you process these emotions, rebuild self-compassion, and eventually open yourself to new beginnings. You’re not irredeemable. Growth begins when we stop punishing ourselves and start learning how to do better. You deserve that chance, too.","Thank you for sharing such a vulnerable part of your journey. The depth of remorse you're feeling speaks to your character and how much you valued your relationship.
To answer your question directly: Yes, therapy would be beneficial. When guilt and self-punishment persist for years despite the other person moving forward, it suggests there's something deeper that needs addressing. This isn't simply about the act of cheating anymore, but about your relationship with forgiveness and self-worth.
It's significant that while your ex has rebuilt her life, you remain anchored to that moment of betrayal. The pain you're experiencing is real, but continuing to punish yourself indefinitely won't undo what happened or make amends. It's preventing you from applying the lessons you've learned and growing from this experience.
Moving forward doesn't mean forgetting or minimizing what happened. Rather, it means accepting responsibility while also allowing yourself the grace to become a better person because of it. A therapist can help you navigate this complex emotional landscape and develop healthier ways to process your regret.
Your suffering doesn't need to be endless to prove you're sorry. Healing is possible, and you deserve that chance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1d48f3x/its_been_23_years_since_we_broke_up_because_i/
"Me (25) and My ex gf (25) been together for 4 years and living together for 2 years, I was unfaithful numerous times even up until the time she left me. It’s a long story no physical intimacy with other but definitely was speaking and hanging with other woman then my partner. She moved out and it’s been a month of no contact. I genuinely want to make it right and I have been staying true to my promise to her before she left. I was at a moment of uncertainty for times and it’s not that she left that I’m realizing but I’m realizing because it was all a head thing (ego) and I honestly want all the plans we had just as I’m sure she does I’m just afraid she may step out with someone else or fall out of love. Will she forgive me and when should I reach out? I want to reconcile and be the best for my partner.",Cheat,"Thank you for sharing something so vulnerable. It sounds like you’re doing a lot of deep reflection, and that’s a meaningful first step. A month of no contact can feel like a lifetime when you’re carrying regret and hoping for reconciliation. It’s okay to want to make things right—but real change takes time, consistency, and a willingness to grow, even if she chooses not to come back.
Right now, focus on becoming the person you say you want to be—not just for her, but for yourself. Rebuilding trust, especially after repeated betrayal, isn’t easy. It’s possible she still cares, but she also deserves time and space to heal and decide what’s best for her.
As for reaching out—only do so when your intention is rooted in respect, not desperation. A sincere, honest message acknowledging your actions, without pressure or expectations, could be a starting point. But no matter what happens, commit to your growth. That’s where your strength lies.","Your post shows a lot of self-awareness and genuine remorse, which is an important first step in healing. It’s clear you deeply regret your actions and want to make things right. The pain of losing someone you love—especially due to your own mistakes—can be overwhelming, and it’s understandable that you’re worried about her moving on. Right now, the best thing you can do is respect her need for space. A month of no contact is still fresh, and she may need more time to process everything. Use this time to reflect, grow, and prove to yourself (and eventually to her) that your change is real. True reconciliation requires patience—not just words, but consistent actions over time. When you do reach out, approach her with humility, honesty, and zero expectations. Acknowledge the hurt you caused and let her lead the conversation. Whether she forgives you or not is her choice, but regardless, this growth will make you a better partner in the future. Stay strong, and take it one day at a time. You’re not alone in this.","Thank you for sharing your situation with such honesty. It takes courage to acknowledge unfaithfulness and the consequences it's brought to your relationship.
The month of no contact has clearly given you time to reflect on what you truly want, which is important. Many people only realize what they had after losing it, and it sounds like this separation has helped clarify your feelings and priorities.
While your desire to reconcile is understandable, I think it's important to respect that your ex-girlfriend needed space for a reason. The trust that was broken repeatedly over your four years together won't be easily or quickly rebuilt. Her decision to move out was likely not made lightly.
If you genuinely want to make things right, focus first on your own growth and understanding why you repeatedly chose to be unfaithful. The changes you're making need to be for yourself, not just to win her back.
As for when to reach out - there's no perfect timing. However, a month may not be enough time for her to heal from multiple betrayals. When you do reach out, approach with humility, without expectations, and be prepared to accept whatever response she gives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jlw4ul/can_you_forgive_a_cheater/
"Feel free to give positive or negative commentary about this I (24F) have been in a relationship with a guy (24M) for over 2 years. It is the most serious one I’ve had yet and I love him so much. But we have spent nearly the last year long distance and I started to realize that with where I’m at in life my needs aren’t being met and it’s not the ideal situation for me. However I loved my bf and I tried to stick it through. I ended up seeing him for a bit and we had a heart to heart and decided that we would continue our relationship until the summer and reevaluate. Fast forward a few weeks later, I am out with friends, I am drunk, and a guy that has been perusing me since I moved away comes up and talks to me. I excuse myself after a while to go to the bathroom and try and find my friend afterwards but fail to do so and we continue talking. Eventually he goes to kiss me and I let him… as I pull away I realize what I did and leave the bar, and text my bf on the taxi ride home and tell him what happened. We break up the next morning. I know we had to break up but I was heartbroken. His family and friends have all removed me from their socials and it hurts cause I was close with them. It’s been a few weeks now and I still feel horrible. He said he forgives me but I feel as if I have scarred who I am forever. I cheated. I have no idea how to get over it. Or if I even should, maybe I deserve to never get rid of the guilt. I read all these stories about how cheaters are awful horrible people but does this one mistake really define who I am? Does all the goodness and kindness I bring to the table now forever get brushed over by this fact? I feel lost. I wish I was strong enough to have broken up with him the right way but I didn’t. I should have gone home that night instead of engaging with the other guy. What are some unbiased opinions about this. AITA? Am I allowed to move on from this? Am I truly a bad person because I cheated?",Cheat,"Thank you for sharing your story with so much openness—what you’re feeling is incredibly heavy, and it’s understandable that you’re struggling right now. You’re not alone in wondering whether one mistake defines you, and the truth is: it doesn’t. Cheating is a serious breach of trust, yes, but what stands out here is your immediate accountability, your honesty, and your remorse. That doesn’t erase the pain it caused, but it does say something about your character.
You’re allowed to grieve, feel guilt, and also grow. You made a mistake during a time of emotional conflict and uncertainty, and you owned it. That’s not nothing. You are not the sum total of your worst moment. You are also the kindness, the love, the self-reflection—and the desire to become better.
Forgiveness, especially self-forgiveness, takes time. What matters now is what you do moving forward. You deserve to learn, heal, and move on. You're not a bad person—you’re a human one.","Your post shows a lot of self-awareness and genuine remorse, which speaks volumes about your character. You made a mistake, but that doesn’t erase all the love, kindness, and goodness you’ve brought into your relationships. Cheating doesn’t define you—it’s an action, not your entire identity. The guilt you’re feeling is natural, but punishing yourself indefinitely won’t help you heal or grow. Long-distance relationships are incredibly tough, especially when your needs aren’t being met. While the way things ended is painful, it sounds like the relationship may not have been sustainable, and this moment forced a difficult but necessary decision. It’s okay to grieve—not just the loss of your boyfriend, but the connections with his family and friends, too. Forgiving yourself is the hardest part, but it’s essential. You’ve acknowledged what happened, taken responsibility, and learned from it. That’s growth. You *are* allowed to move forward. Let this be a lesson, not a life sentence. Be kind to yourself—you’re human, and healing takes time. You’re not a bad person; you’re someone who made a mistake and deserves compassion, especially from yourself.","Thank you for sharing something so difficult and personal. The pain and regret in your words really come through.
One mistake doesn't define your entire character or erase all the good you've done. While cheating caused real hurt, it happened in a complex context - you were already questioning the relationship, dealing with unmet needs in a long-distance situation, and made a poor decision while intoxicated. This doesn't excuse the action, but it does provide important context.
What speaks to your character is what you did afterward: you immediately told your boyfriend rather than hiding it, and you're now deeply reflecting on your actions instead of minimizing them. Many people would have kept it secret or blamed circumstances entirely.
The guilt you feel is natural and shows your moral compass is intact. However, endless self-punishment serves no one. The healthier path forward involves accepting responsibility (which you've done), learning from this experience, using it to make better choices in future relationships, and practicing self-forgiveness while honoring the lesson.

"Four years ago I made a mistake my cheating on my boyfriend, and the guilt has been eating me up for years.Now that we are finally about to get married I'm wondering if I should come clean, but I'm scared of losing him.
I've (28F) been in a relationship with my boyfriend (28M) for eight years, and we're about to get married. However, there's something weighing heavily on my conscience. About four years ago, during a rough patch in our relationship, I made a terrible mistake – I cheated on him for about two months.
Since then, I've felt consumed by guilt and regret, but I never found the courage to confess. Now, as we're on the brink of getting married, I'm faced with an agonizing decision. Should I come clean before the wedding with the possible risk destroying everything we've built together? Or should I keep this secret buried, knowing it could haunt me forever?
I'm torn between my desire to be honest and my fear of losing the person I love. I know that telling him would shatter his trust in me, but I also worry about the consequences of starting our marriage with such a significant lie between us.
Since my little cheating journey I really have changed a lot, and have grown to be a much better person than I was 4 years ago. Deep down I know he deserved to know a long time ago, but I really don't know if confessing would be worth it. That isn't who I am anymore, and possibly losing him over my past self would be devastating.
I'm seeking advice on what to do in this impossible situation. Should I confess and risk losing him, or should I keep quiet and try to move forward with our wedding? Any guidance would be deeply appreciated.",Cheat,"Thank you for being so open about something so deeply painful and personal. It’s clear that you’ve carried this guilt for a long time, and that it’s coming from a place of genuine remorse and growth—not just fear. This situation is incredibly complicated, and there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but the fact that you’re even grappling with this shows your integrity.
What you’re feeling is valid: the fear of losing someone you love versus the weight of starting a marriage with a secret. Only you can ultimately decide what feels right, but consider this—marriage is built on trust, vulnerability, and honesty. If you feel this will continue to haunt you or affect how you show up in your relationship, that may be a sign that transparency is necessary for you, regardless of the outcome.
You’re not the person you were then, and that matters. Whether or not you choose to confess, give yourself credit for how far you’ve come. Growth is real, even when it’s messy. Whatever you choose, be kind to yourself—you’re trying to do the right thing, and that says a lot about who you are today.","Your post shows how deeply you care about your partner and your relationship, and it’s clear how much this guilt has weighed on you. It takes a lot of courage to reflect on past mistakes and wrestle with such a difficult decision, especially when the stakes feel so high. You’re right that honesty is a foundation of trust in marriage, but this situation is incredibly complex. Before deciding, consider: Would confessing now bring him peace, or would it only ease your guilt at the risk of his pain? On the other hand, keeping it buried may strain your emotional well-being over time. Since you’ve genuinely changed, reflect on whether this secret affects how you show up in the relationship now. If it doesn’t, and you’re fully committed, it may be worth focusing on the love and growth you’ve built since. But if the guilt continues to haunt you, seeking guidance from a therapist or counselor could help you navigate this without making a rushed choice. Whatever you decide, remember: growth matters. You’re not the same person you were four years ago, and that growth is worth honoring. You’re not alone in this—many have faced similar struggles. Be gentle with yourself.","Thank you for sharing such a difficult personal situation. The internal conflict you're experiencing makes complete sense - you're caught between wanting to build your marriage on honesty and fearing the potential consequences of revealing this truth.
This is truly a challenging moral dilemma. On one hand, confessing gives your partner the information he deserves to make fully informed decisions about your relationship. On the other, it risks causing significant pain and potentially ending a relationship that has grown and evolved since that mistake four years ago.
What stands out is your genuine remorse and the personal growth you've experienced since then. Many people who cheat don't take that difficult journey of self-reflection and change.
Before making your decision, consider speaking with a therapist who specializes in relationships. They can help you explore your motivations - are you seeking confession for your own relief or for his benefit? They can also help you prepare for either path forward.
If you do decide to tell him, approach the conversation with complete accountability, without justifications or expecting forgiveness. Be prepared that he might need time to process, and the outcome is uncertain.
Whatever you decide, be compassionate with yourself while holding yourself accountable. This situation doesn't define your entire character or future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1axojsz/should_i_28f_tell_my_boyfriend_28m_about_the_time/
"I cheated on my wife last night. don't know what to do. Obviously I need to tell her, but I still haven't even been able to get my head around it.
One of my coworkers were leaving so we all went out for drinks, and then to a club - she's not a drinking or clubbing type so she stayed home but was fine with me going.
I was drunk, I know I was drunk, my head is still pounding. I remember being at the bar, then at the club, then waking up with a woman I didn't know on top of me in a house I didn't know. She said something like oh shit I thought you were asleep and got off of me, I got my clothes and quickly got the hell out of there. I walked for however long until I got a taxi and I got home at like 6am.
My wife works early shifts so started work at 5am and I haven't even seen her. I don't know who the woman was, I haven't spoken to my coworkers. I had sex with her, or I was having sex with her, I don't even remember getting there, I don't remember leaving the club with her.
I love my wife. I don't know what the fuck I was thinking, even drunk I don't know how I could've even had it in my subconscious to cheat on her. I don't even think I was that drunk, like I'd only had 3 or 4 beers before going to the club and I usually have a pretty high tolerance.
I cheated on my wife and I don't even remember. I don't know what to do now. I haven't gotten out of bed since getting home except to throw up and I don't know if I'll even be able to look my wife in the eye when she gets home in a couple of hours.
I feel so so sick.",Cheat,"Thank you for opening up in such a raw and painful moment—what you’re going through is incredibly intense, and it’s clear that you’re overwhelmed with guilt, confusion, and fear. What happened is serious, and it makes complete sense that you're in shock right now, trying to piece everything together. The uncertainty of how things unfolded only adds to the emotional weight you're carrying.
Right now, try to take things one step at a time. It’s okay to not have all the answers yet, especially when you're still physically and emotionally recovering from the night. But your instinct to be honest with your wife speaks volumes. It shows that you still care deeply about her and the integrity of your relationship.
When you're ready, speak from the heart—share what you know, what you don't, and how devastated you are. It’s going to be hard, but honesty gives both of you a path forward, however that may look. You’re not alone in this—please consider talking to a therapist or counselor to help process what happened and what comes next. You’re human, and while this is painful, it’s not beyond healing.","Your post shows how deeply you’re struggling with guilt, confusion, and regret, and I want you to know your feelings are valid.

The fact that you’re thinking about telling your wife speaks to your love for her and your desire to do the right thing, even though this is incredibly painful. Before you talk to her, take a moment to ground yourself. The shock and physical aftermath (like your headache and nausea) might be making everything feel even more intense. When you’re ready, consider writing down what you *do* remember—not to justify anything, but to organize your thoughts. This might help you have a clearer conversation with your wife when the time comes. You’re facing a difficult situation, but you don’t have to navigate it alone. If possible, reach out to a trusted friend or a professional (like a therapist or counselor) who can offer nonjudgmental support as you process this. Whatever happens next, remember that healing is possible, even when things feel impossible right now. You’re human, and humans make mistakes—what matters now is how you move forward with honesty and care.","Thank you for sharing such a difficult and confusing situation. From what you've described, there are some very concerning elements about your experience that go beyond typical cheating scenarios.
Waking up with someone you don't know on top of you, with no memory of how you got there, raises serious red flags about consent and possible drugging. The fact that you only had 3-4 beers despite having a high tolerance, yet experienced such significant memory loss, is particularly troubling. This scenario has elements that sound like potential sexual assault rather than consensual infidelity.
Before labeling this as cheating, please consider speaking with a trusted friend, counselor, or calling a sexual assault helpline to process what happened. Your physical symptoms and emotional distress are natural responses to trauma.
When your wife returns, you'll need to have an honest conversation, but frame it around what you actually know happened versus assuming full responsibility for something where your consent may have been compromised. This will be incredibly difficult, but approaching it with honesty about the gaps in your memory is important.

The pain in your words is clear, and I can feel how broken you are over everything that’s happened. What your husband is experiencing is deep heartbreak and trauma—and right now, he's not in a place where he can hear you, and that’s incredibly hard, especially when you want to explain and make things right. But this moment isn’t just about fixing the relationship—it’s about ensuring he’s safe, and you're both emotionally supported.
If you haven’t already, please encourage someone he trusts—maybe a family member or mental health professional—to check in on him. Self-harm is serious, and he needs help, even if it doesn’t come from you right now.
As for you: you're not evil. You made a serious mistake, yes, but you're also feeling deep remorse. That matters. Healing—for both of you—will take time. Focus on being stable and supportive, especially for your son. Therapy—for you, and hopefully one day for both of you—can be a powerful step. Even if reconciliation doesn’t happen, growth and redemption are possible. One day, he may be ready to talk. Until then, show your love through actions, patience, and accountability.","I hear how much pain you’re in, and how deeply you regret what happened. It’s clear you love your husband and your family, and seeing him hurt this way is devastating for you. Right now, he’s dealing with immense betrayal, and his reaction—withdrawal, depression, and self-harm—shows just how deeply this has wounded him. It’s important to respect his need for space while he processes this. Pushing him to talk or reconcile before he’s ready may only push him further away. For now, focus on being consistent and patient. Let him see his son without pressure, and if he’s open to it, consider writing him a letter to express your remorse—not to justify what happened, but to acknowledge his pain and take accountability. Therapy, both individually and (if he’s willing) as a couple, could help navigate this. But healing will take time, and you must prepare for the possibility that he may not trust you again. Be kind to yourself, too. Understanding why you cheated—whether through therapy or self-reflection—is crucial so you can grow from this, whether or not your marriage survives. You’re not evil; you made choices that hurt someone you love, and now you’re facing the consequences. That’s incredibly hard, but it’s also where change begins.","Thank you for sharing such a painful situation. The anguish you're feeling comes through clearly in your words, and I can see you're desperate to repair what's been broken.
First, I want to acknowledge the severity of the situation. A three-year affair is a profound betrayal that has deeply traumatized your husband. His self-harm, withdrawal, and inability to face you are all signs of serious emotional trauma. His safety should be the immediate priority—if you believe he's actively harming himself, please ensure someone trustworthy is supporting him.
Right now, your husband needs space. Pushing for conversation when he's not ready will likely push him further away. Instead, consider writing him a letter taking full responsibility (without excuses) and expressing your remorse, then giving him time to process it on his own terms.
This situation requires professional help. I strongly recommend seeking individual therapy for yourself to understand why you made these choices, and eventually, if he's willing, couples counseling.
Focus on being a good co-parent and respecting his boundaries right now. Rebuilding trust, if possible at all, will take considerable time and consistent effort on your part. There's no quick solution to healing this level of betrayal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1crx4p5/i_cheated_on_my_husband_what_should_i_do_to_make/
"It's simple. I cheated and I was in the wrong.
We had been dating for nearly 5 years at the time. Our sex life was gone and we did nothing but fight. Sometimes when I tried to initiate, he'd decline and start masturbating, and it made me feel like a piece of shit.
I tried to talk to him, and suggested couples counseling but he was having none of it.
It was just tiring and demeaning and I felt like shit in our relationship. I told him this and he said I was overdramatic and seeking attention as always.
Then, I met the other guy. Let's call him S.
S was a guy I was paired with for some work. He was attractive, smart and friendly. He started flirting with me, and I loved it, but I told him I had a boyfriend. He stopped and we just chatted as friends for a while. He gave me his number.
S respected my relationship and never complimented me, but I would see his eyes running up and down when he saw me and he was so kind in his words with me that he made me feel like something more than a punching bag.
I fell for him. Hard. I thought it may just be a passing infatuation and went home to my bf. I tried to initiate with him, but he again turned me down, for the fifth time that week. We both got angry and yelled at each other, me calling him sexually incompatible, him calling me a needy bitch.
I went out of the house in rage and called up a coworker friend, asking if I could stay the night. She said she had her mom over so there wasn't space in her house and apologised. In the heat of the moment, I called up S and asked him if I could stay with him for the night.
He lived 5 kilometres away (around 3 miles) and drove to a cafe where I was sitting to pick me up. This alone was more than what my bf had done for me in the last year.
We drove to his house in silence and he never once made a move one me.
At his house, he said the guest bedroom was ready for me. We sat down to watch some TV together and I started thinking about my relationship and how it wasn't salvageable anymore.
I started crying. I cried and when he noticed that, he paused everything and hugged me, asking me what was wrong and what happened. He dried my tears, made me laugh, made me feel loved again.
I kissed him. He held me in, enjoying it but then pulled away and said, ""You have a boyfriend.""
I told him I did, but he was the one I wanted to be with and we had sex that night. The next morning, I was laying in bed next to him and thought about how good last night was. How he made me feel like a woman instead of a hole, how he paid attention to every square inch of my body, kissing the parts my bf used to make fun of.
Weirdly, I didn't feel any guilt, just happiness. I went home, thinking I'd confess last night to my bf. However, as soon as I walked in, he greeted me by saying the drama queen was home and he made a comment about how quiet it was last night without needy me in his ear.
I couldn't get a word out and then I had to leave for work. I met S there and we talked. He asked how I was feeling and if me and my bf were done.
I told him that we were officially still together, but I planned on breaking up with him next week, when he'd come back from a trip with friends because I didn't want to do such a shitty thing to him via text.
We thought we would control ourselves for a week, but we couldn't and had sex multiple times the past week. To my joy, his libido matched mine and I think I fell in love with him. I thought absence of the bf may make the heart grow fonder, but every second I spent with S showed me just how bad he neglected me.
So, he comes home in two days. He was always suspicious of S, but I reassured him he was just a work friend, which was true till last week.
How do I tell him I'm breaking up with him in the gentlest way possible? The house we live in belongs to my mom so he'll be the one who has to leave and that will be really harsh on him.
He was an asshole the last two years, but I still loved him once and don't want to hurt him more than I need to. How do I go about this?",Cheat,"Thank you for sharing your story—it’s layered, emotional, and filled with pain and conflict. It’s clear you were deeply hurt in your relationship, and it’s understandable to crave connection, kindness, and feeling valued after being dismissed and neglected for so long. No one deserves to feel like they’re “too much” just for wanting love, respect, and intimacy. What happened with S didn’t come from nowhere—it came from a place of emotional exhaustion and unmet needs.
That said, you already know that the cheating crossed a boundary, and you're taking ownership of that, which matters. What happens now is about minimizing further harm while being honest and clear. When you talk to your boyfriend, center the conversation around your truth, not S. This isn't just about infidelity—it’s about a relationship that stopped being healthy for both of you. Be calm, firm, and kind. You’re allowed to walk away from something that was hurting you. Healing—for both of you—can only begin with honesty.","Your post shows a lot of self-awareness and emotional complexity, and I can hear how torn you feel despite the pain of your current relationship. It’s clear you’ve been hurting for a long time—feeling rejected, unheard, and demeaned by someone you once loved deeply. While cheating is rarely the ideal path, I can also see how S became a source of comfort and validation when your relationship left you feeling invisible. You deserve to be with someone who cherishes you, respects your needs, and makes you feel valued. Breaking up is never easy, especially when there’s history, but honesty and kindness can help soften the blow. When you talk to your boyfriend, focus on your feelings rather than placing blame. You might say something like, *""This relationship hasn’t been working for either of us, and I think we’ve both been unhappy for a long time. I care about you, but I can’t keep going like this.""* Acknowledge the good times you shared, but be firm in your decision. Since he’ll need to move out, offering practical support (like time to arrange housing) could ease the transition. You’re allowed to prioritize your happiness—this isn’t just about S, but about choosing a life where you feel seen and loved. Wishing you strength in this conversation. 💛","Thank you for sharing your story with such honesty. It's clear you've been in a relationship that became emotionally damaging, with your needs dismissed and your feelings invalidated. That kind of treatment can be incredibly harmful to your self-worth over time.
While cheating isn't the ideal way to end a relationship, I understand how you reached this point after years of trying to communicate and being shut down. The contrast between how S treats you and how your boyfriend has been treating you seems to have provided clarity about what you actually deserve in a relationship.
For the breakup conversation, I'd suggest being direct but kind. Focus on the relationship issues rather than S - explain that you've realized you're fundamentally incompatible and unhappy together. Give him time to process and make arrangements to move out. Since it's your mother's house, perhaps you could discuss a reasonable timeframe for him to find new housing.
This will be difficult, but remember that ending a relationship that makes you both unhappy isn't cruel - continuing it would be. You deserve to be with someone who respects you, values your feelings, and treats you with kindness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/w6uiwx/i_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_and_fell_in_love_with/
"My adventure started out so innocently. I've always been, head over heels deeply in love with my boyfriend of two years. But then, things took a turn, and I found myself caught up in something I never imagined.
It all began at a friend's party. There was this guy (22M) – charming, with a smile that could light up a room. We got to talking, and before I knew it, we were exchanging numbers. I didn't think much of it at the time, it was just harmless fun originally.
But then we started meeting up, sneaking around behind my boyfriend's back. Each time, the guilt ate away at me, but I couldn't stop. It was like I was hooked on this adrenaline rush, this secret thrill.
And then, boom. My boyfriend found out. The look on his face, the hurt in his eyes – it broke me. I never meant to hurt him, truly, but I messed up big time. Now, I'm left picking up the pieces of what I shattered.
I wish I could turn back time, take it all back, but I can't. All I can do is try to learn from my mistakes and hope he can forgive me. It's a tough lesson to learn, but I'm determined to come out of this a better person. What can/should I do to fix what i've done? I feel terrible for hurting him the way I did; I wanna win my now ex boyfriend back, earn his trust again, and I'd do anything for it.",Cheat,"Thank you for sharing your story so openly—it takes a lot of courage to face your mistakes and sit with the pain they’ve caused. What stands out most is your genuine remorse and your willingness to reflect and grow. That matters. You’re not trying to justify what happened; you’re owning it, and that’s the first step toward any kind of healing.
Right now, your ex is likely feeling betrayed and heartbroken, and rebuilding trust won’t happen quickly—if it happens at all. The best thing you can do for him and yourself is to continue doing the inner work. Focus on understanding what led you down this path: Was it emotional neglect, temptation, or a need for validation? Therapy or journaling might help you unpack that.
If you truly want a second chance, give him space while showing through consistent, respectful actions that you’ve changed. Apologies are important—but growth speaks louder. And if he doesn’t come back, it doesn’t mean your growth is wasted. It means you’re becoming someone who’ll show up better in all future relationships, including the one you have with yourself. You’re not beyond redemption—this can be a turning point.","Your post shows a lot of self-awareness and genuine remorse, which is an important first step. It’s clear you deeply care about your ex-boyfriend and regret the pain you caused. Healing from this will take time, patience, and honesty—both with him and yourself. Start by giving him space. He needs time to process his emotions, and pushing for reconciliation too soon may backfire. When he’s ready to talk, apologize sincerely—without excuses. Acknowledge the hurt you caused, take full responsibility, and let him express his feelings without defensiveness. Rebuilding trust is a slow process. If he’s open to it, demonstrate through consistent actions—not just words—that you’ve changed. Be transparent, respect his boundaries, and accept that he may not be ready to forgive. Meanwhile, reflect on what led you down this path. Understanding your choices can help you grow and avoid repeating them. If reconciliation isn’t possible, use this as a painful but valuable lesson. Growth often comes from our hardest mistakes. You’re already taking steps toward becoming a better person—that’s something to hold onto, no matter the outcome.","Thank you for sharing your experience so openly. The regret in your words is palpable, and it's clear you're truly grappling with the consequences of your actions.
What you're describing goes beyond a momentary lapse - the repeated meetups suggest there was something missing or unaddressed in your relationship or within yourself. Understanding this ""why"" is crucial before you can genuinely move forward, whether with your ex or not.
While your desire to win him back is understandable, focusing first on your own growth might be more important. Ask yourself: What led you to make these choices despite loving him? What needs weren't being met? What boundaries did you fail to set with yourself?
If reconciliation is possible, it will require tremendous patience. Trust, once broken, doesn't heal overnight. Your ex deserves space to process his pain without pressure. Real change will speak louder than promises or grand gestures.
Consider speaking with a therapist who can help you understand your patterns and develop healthier relationship skills. Whether this relationship can be saved or not, this painful experience can become valuable if it leads to genuine growth and self-awareness.
Remember that forgiveness - both from him and yourself - is a process, not an event.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1axxg12/my_20f_boyfriend_20m_found_out_that_i_cheated_on/
"4 years ago I was in a pretty serious relationship with a girl I really did love. I had actually been debating how to propose. She told me she thought we should take a week long break so I could “figure out who I was”. I find out at the end of the week she’d been cheating on me with literally the guy she told me not to worry about. That was 3 years of my life down the drain.
This just destroyed my self esteem and self worth. It never really recovered. Most days I feel worthless, some are better than others though. Ive constantly wondered what I did wrong since then, or what I could’ve done better. I assume anytime anyone compliments me they’re just lying and they tolerate me because they have to. Some days it just doesn’t seem worth it. All the things that used to be fun are usually just dull.
Since then the thought of a relationship with another woman terrifies me. My desire for a relationship is trumped by my fear of getting hurt like that again. Frankly I don’t see myself getting into another relationship. Therapy didn’t really help and I’m too terrified to try out another relationship. I don’t know what to do anymore.",Cheated On,"Thank you for sharing this—it’s incredibly brave to open up about pain that still lingers so deeply. What happened to you wasn’t just heartbreak; it was betrayal, and it makes complete sense that it shattered your trust and sense of worth. When someone you love hurts you like that, it can twist the way you see yourself and the world. But please know: you didn’t deserve what happened. Her actions were about her choices, not your value.
Healing from something like this isn’t linear. Some days might feel okay, and others feel unbearable. That doesn’t mean you’re weak—it means you’re human. The fact that you’re still here, still reaching out, still hoping there’s a way forward? That speaks volumes.
Even if therapy didn’t help before, that doesn’t mean nothing can. Sometimes it takes the right therapist, the right approach, or just more time. You don’t have to force yourself into dating again until you feel ready—this is your journey. But I promise you’re not broken beyond repair, and you’re not alone in feeling this way. There is a future where joy feels real again, even if you can’t quite see it yet. And you’re worthy of that future.","Your pain is completely valid, and I’m so sorry you’ve had to carry this heavy burden for so long. Betrayal, especially from someone you deeply loved and trusted, can shatter your sense of self in ways that feel impossible to rebuild. It’s understandable that you’re hesitant to open up again—heartbreak like that leaves deep scars.
You didn’t deserve what happened to you. Her actions were a reflection of her, not you. It’s heartbreaking to hear you blame yourself or feel unworthy of love because of someone else’s dishonesty. You are not defined by her choices. The fact that you loved deeply and were willing to commit speaks volumes about your capacity for care and loyalty—qualities that are precious and rare.
It’s okay that therapy didn’t click right away; healing isn’t linear, and sometimes it takes time to find the right approach or support. You’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s okay to take things one day at a time. You matter, and your feelings matter. If you ever want to talk more, I’m here to listen. You don’t have to navigate this alone.","I'm really sorry to hear about your experience. Having someone you loved and trusted betray you like that is incredibly painful, and it's understandable that it's affected you so deeply. That kind of betrayal can leave lasting wounds that don't heal easily.
What happened wasn't your fault. When someone cheats, that's their choice and their failing—not yours. The fact that she blamed you by suggesting you needed to ""figure out who you were"" while she was the one being unfaithful shows this was about her issues, not yours.
It makes complete sense that you're scared to try again. You invested three years and were planning a future with someone who hurt you profoundly. That kind of pain creates protective barriers.
Your feelings of worthlessness and the dulling of things you once enjoyed sound like you might be experiencing depression triggered by this trauma. Since therapy didn't help before, perhaps a different therapist or approach might work better—someone who specializes in betrayal trauma.
Please know that your worth isn't determined by how one person treated you. Healing takes time, and it's okay to move at your own pace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1d4vg8p/i_got_cheated_on_4_years_ago_and_have_been/
"I’m a 19 year old college student and my girlfriend is 20. Anyways, I baked some valentines cookies tonight with my girlfriend (now ex). And when we were watching a movie eating them she went to the bathroom and her phone gets 4 snapchat notifications. The bitmoji is a dude. When she got back I asked to see the texts he sent and she said it was her friend Ashley and she opened snapchat and scrolled right past the dude to Ashley and tried hiding it. When I asked again to see the texts she started to hide her phone and yeah after some minutes of convincing her to give it to me she finally did and first thing I see is a picture of the valentines cookies we made 20 minutes ago with like 3 pages of nudes right below from the last few days (was with her all of these days). Earlier she told me about a party she was going to tomorrow night. Shortly before we baked the cookies, I brought up how I don’t like parties in a relationship (I’ve done this a few times when she goes out but I never stopped her) and my concerns and she reassured me and made me feel way better about it and even offered me to go with her so I just assumed I was just overthinking. THIS WAS LITERALLY RIGHT BEFORE SHE TOOK THE PICTURE OF THE COOKIES WE BAKED. Also, junior year of highschool my girlfriend hooked up with my bestfriend since childhood. I truly don’t think I’ll ever be able to trust anybody. People are fucked. This is my first time being in love and I get cheated on, I know it’s time that heals but what else can I do to speed it up? How will I get rid of these trust issues? I had them this entire relationship as well and now they’re gonna be worse. And how do I stop thinking about the WHY she cheated?",Cheated On,"I'm really sorry you're going through this. It’s completely devastating to be betrayed by someone you trusted and loved, especially when you gave them your time, effort, and heart. What happened wasn’t your fault—you were honest about your feelings, you communicated your boundaries, and you gave her the benefit of the doubt. Her actions were a choice, not a reflection of your worth.
Right now, it’s normal to feel angry, confused, and broken. You’re asking why, but sometimes there’s no answer that makes the pain easier to bear. People cheat for their own selfish reasons, not because the person they’re with isn’t enough.
To begin healing, focus on taking care of yourself—talk to friends you trust, journal your thoughts, or try something creative or physical to help release the emotion. Therapy can help too, especially with rebuilding trust—not just in others, but in yourself.
You’re young, and this pain won’t define your whole story. The fact that you still care so deeply means you have so much love to give. One day, someone will value that love the way it deserves. Let this hurt fuel your growth, not harden your heart. You're not alone.","I’m so sorry you’re going through this—betrayal cuts deep, especially when it brings up past pain too. It’s completely normal to feel shattered, angry, and stuck wondering why. You didn’t deserve this, and her actions say everything about her and nothing about your worth. Love shouldn’t come with lies or hidden nudes; your instincts were right, and that’s not insecurity—it’s self-respect.
Trust issues make sense after being hurt like this, but they don’t have to define your future. Healing isn’t about speeding up time—it’s about giving yourself permission to feel this fully. Write, scream, talk to someone who gets it. The ""why"" will haunt you, but her reasons don’t matter as much as your recovery. Cheating is a choice, not a mistake, and it’s her loss.
When you’re ready, small steps help: notice when your brain generalizes (""all people are fucked"") and challenge it. Not everyone is like her. Therapy (if accessible) or support groups can rebuild trust in your judgment again. You loved deeply—that’s courage, not weakness. One day, this pain will be a chapter, not the whole story. You’re not alone.","I'm so sorry you're going through this painful experience. Finding out someone you trusted and loved has betrayed you - especially in such a blatant way - is absolutely devastating. The fact that this happened right after sharing an intimate moment like baking cookies together, and while she was actively reassuring you about the party, makes it even more hurtful.
Given your past experience with betrayal from a friend in high school, I understand why you're feeling like trust might be impossible now. These repeated wounds can make us question our judgment and worth, but please know this reflects on their character, not yours.
There's no magic solution to speed up healing, but acknowledging your pain rather than suppressing it is important. Focus on self-care and reconnecting with supportive friends or family. Consider talking to a counselor who specializes in relationship trauma - they can provide strategies for processing these feelings.
As for the ""why"" - that's often the hardest question. Sometimes there isn't a satisfying answer, and the reason may have nothing to do with you and everything to do with her own issues.
You deserve someone who respects your boundaries and treats your heart with care. This pain won't last forever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ivonsi/got_cheated_on_last_night_is_there_any_way_to_get/
"I am in a long term relationship since around 10 years. Its my first ever Relationship and we were together since we are teens. At the end of last year my SO told me she doesn't know if she loves me anymore or if she is just used to me and that she needs space to think about things but not wanting to break things off at first. After a month she said she decided she needs and loves me. She told me there was another guy that was interested in her in the meantime but she wasnt interested. We got back on track but i had my doubts since. A couple of days ago i couldnt take it anymore and searched her phone and what i found made me nearly throw up immediatly. It seems she cheated on me on multiple occasions with said guy and got together with me as he ghosted her. While we had the break she made me feel like i am the reason she isnt sure but now i think she just wanted the adventure. I was ready to settle down with her, wanting to ask her the one question last year but now my trust is gone, in people overall. This year was hard as i lost important people, had a life altering incident which changed my apperance forever and all i had was her. I am pretty much alone in this city, and am still studying so have no money to live alone. She was this childish, innocent teen gf of mine, we always were ""the dream couple"" of my friend group and she threw it under the bus for some older guy that has money. I havent told her yet that i know, i wierdly still love and need her, but deep down i am depressed as fck and after this and the last couple years i feel like my life peaked 5 years ago and now most of my life dissolved under my feet. Honestly dont know what i am living for now, as all my values got shattered in the past years. It was my last straw. Honestly, i am scared to be awake and sleep most of my days away.",Cheated On,"I'm really sorry you're going through this—your pain is real, and you're not alone. What happened wasn’t just a betrayal from someone you trusted, it came at a time when you were already carrying so much. You’ve endured loss, a life-changing experience, and now this—so it makes sense that you feel like the ground’s disappeared beneath you. It’s okay to still love her and feel lost, even after what she did. Love and hurt can exist at the same time, and that doesn’t make you weak—it makes you human.
Right now, you don’t need to have all the answers. What you do need is support. Please don’t carry this alone. Reach out to a therapist, a counselor at your university, or even a trusted friend. Talking helps, even when it feels pointless at first. You are not your pain, and your life hasn’t peaked. The version of you who loved deeply and believed in forever is still inside you—and you will find stability and trust again. Please hold on. You matter more than you know.","I’m so deeply sorry for the pain you’re carrying—this kind of betrayal cuts to the core, especially when it comes from someone you’ve loved and trusted for so long. It’s heartbreaking to realize the person you saw a future with chose to deceive you, and it’s completely understandable to feel lost, depressed, and even physically sick from the weight of it all. You didn’t deserve this. None of it—not the cheating, not the gaslighting, not the loneliness that followed an already devastating year.
What you’re feeling—the love mixed with betrayal, the fear of being alone, the numbness—makes so much sense. Ten years is a lifetime at your age, and it’s okay to grieve the future you thought you’d have. But please know: her actions don’t define your worth. You were ready to commit; she chose to betray. That’s on her, not you.
Right now, survival is enough. Sleep if you need to, but try to reach out to even one friend or counselor when you can. You don’t have to face this alone. The fog will lift, even if it doesn’t feel that way yet. You mattered before her, and you’ll matter after. One step at a time.","I'm so sorry you're going through this devastating betrayal after 10 years together. Finding out the truth about her cheating, especially after you were ready to propose, must feel like having your entire foundation crumble beneath you. The fact that this is happening while you're already dealing with other significant losses and challenges makes it even more overwhelming.
It's completely understandable that you're experiencing depression and struggling to find meaning right now. When someone we've built our life around betrays our trust so deeply, it can make us question everything we thought we knew - about them, about relationships, and even about ourselves.
The conflicting feelings you're having - still loving her despite the pain she's caused - are normal. Ten years is a significant part of your life, and those feelings don't disappear overnight, even when faced with betrayal.
Given your financial situation and isolation in the city, this puts you in an especially difficult position. However, living with someone who has violated your trust so profoundly will likely continue to damage your mental health.
Is there anyone from your support network you could reach out to right now? Even if they're not physically nearby, connecting with someone who cares about you might help you feel less alone as you navigate these painful decisions.RetryClaude can make mistakes.

"My wife decided to step out and cheat on me with a co worker who has an office right across from hers. There’s a long story behind this where I wasn’t meeting her emotional needs plus dealt with a porn issue, but I never physically cheated on her with someone else and I’ve taken accountability and steps to resolve the porn issue. She’s now remorseful and states she understands why they say the grass isn’t always greener on the other side, and that she was chasing an emotional high bc she felt deprived for so long… but I’m having the hardest time not picturing another man inside of her (that she also sent nude/sexual photos and videos to) and “getting over that”.
So I’m here to ask you: if you’ve ever been cheated on, married individuals more specifically but open to any and all opinions, were you able to reconcile and get over it? The images are so vivid in my head I can’t even look at her at times without feeling the biggest pit in my stomach, but I really do love this woman and we’ve both done our fair share of hurting in our relationship.. we have two kids 5 and 9 and I’m 29 she’s 28 and we’ve been together for 11 years.
Our marriage therapist gave us divorce statistics and showed us that our best theoretical chance of a long standing forever marriage is right now with each other as with each divorce and marriage that number goes up almost 10% each time, but we both have to make the conscious decision to re commit to each other and build something new as what we had is now gone.. what are your thoughts?",Cheated On,"Thank you for opening up—it’s incredibly hard to share something so raw, and I can feel the depth of your pain in every word. Betrayal cuts deep, especially when it comes from someone you’ve built a life and family with. The vivid thoughts you're experiencing are a normal trauma response to infidelity, and they don’t make you weak—they’re your brain’s way of trying to process the shock and grief.
It’s powerful that you’ve both taken accountability for past hurt, and it’s clear you’re trying to rebuild with intention. Reconciliation is possible—but it’s not about forgetting what happened, it’s about learning how to carry the pain differently. It’s not about getting back to what you had, but creating something new—like your therapist said.
That journey is long and messy, and it needs honesty, vulnerability, and a ton of patience. Give yourself permission to not have it all figured out right now. You can love her and still feel devastated. Whatever you decide, know that your feelings are valid, and healing is possible—even if it’s one breath at a time. You’re not alone in this.","I hear the deep pain and conflict in your words, and my heart goes out to you. Betrayal trauma is real, and those intrusive images—the visceral hurt of imagining her with someone else—are a normal, agonizing part of processing infidelity. It’s clear you love your wife and are grappling with the shattered trust while also holding space for your own accountability in the marriage’s struggles. That’s incredibly hard, and it speaks to your commitment.
Reconciliation is possible, but it’s a long, uneven road. The key factors are genuine remorse (which she seems to have), full transparency (no trickle-truthing), and time. The images won’t fade overnight, but with therapy and open communication, their grip can lessen. Many couples rebuild stronger marriages after infidelity—but only if both partners are all-in. Your therapist’s point about recommitting is valid, but don’t stay just for statistics or kids. Ask yourself: Can you two create a new relationship where needs are met healthily? Can you eventually forgive (even if never forget)?
Your feelings are valid. Healing isn’t linear. If you choose to stay, prioritize your healing too—individual therapy, support groups (like r/AsOneAfterInfidelity), and patience with yourself. You deserve peace, whether that’s with her or without.
New chat","I'm truly sorry you're going through this painful experience. The intrusive images and thoughts you're having are an extremely common response to infidelity trauma. There's something particularly visceral about picturing your spouse with someone else that can feel impossible to overcome in the moment.
What you're describing - that stomach-dropping feeling, the difficulty even looking at her sometimes - is your mind and body processing a significant betrayal. These reactions aren't weakness; they're normal responses to a profound hurt.
The reality is that some couples do successfully rebuild after infidelity, while others find the breach of trust too significant to repair. This isn't about statistics but about whether both of you can commit to the difficult work ahead - not just addressing the infidelity but also the underlying issues in your relationship that created vulnerability.
For reconciliation to work, she needs to demonstrate consistent remorse through actions, not just words, and establish complete transparency. You'll need to work through your trauma while also addressing your contribution to the relationship problems.
This will take time - likely years, not months. The couples who make it through often say they built something different but stronger than what they had before.
Whatever you decide, make sure it's what you truly want, not just what seems best for the children or what statistics suggest.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1grg1lm/my_wife_cheated_on_me/
"Im a 29 male from France, and im very this kind of loyal, comitted and love bombing boyfriend when it comes to being in a relationship. I've juste gotten out of a previous relationship that tore me down as well. And I needed to see therapists for 3 years because of it.
Anyway, I meet this magnificient woman at Salsa class in 2021, and we both get along really well. We dance a lot together and we develope a true friendship with time passing by. I could already start feeling the butterflies in my stomach but I needed to crush any hope of getting a relationship since at that time she had a boyfriend
In 2022, she invites me to her birthday, and everyone of her friends are here, obviously her boyfriend was here too. However after the party, his bf wanted to spend time with friends, leaving us two alone to enjoy the citynight life. We ended up having the most beautiful accidental ""date"" night and we laughed about it. Little did she know I started having a strong crush for her.
Fastforward, 2 months later, she calls me admitting that she had feelings for me and she left her boyfriend, because she was feeling ""lost"". I couldnt start anything yet because I was in an other city for a month at that time. I learned that 1 week after her breakup, she already found a sexfriend while waiting for me (first big reflag that I shouldnt have ignored), it broke me down a little but I was mad in love..
We ended up starting a relationship together, while she admitted having cheated on her ex 4 times during her previous relationship (2nd redflag). But she had this very thoughtful discusssion where she said she grew up from all of this things, and promised she wouldnt make someone suffer again.
I believed her.
In 2024, this year. Things started being very weird... There was times where she would be very anxious and I tried to calm her. She met a guy from university and started texting him a lot (until 1am) which brought up a lot of arguments since I cant accept that kind of shady behaviour. She showed me a lot of her conversations with her male friends, but I kept seeing the notifications from that ""just friend"" from uni. And everytime I asked to see what he was saying, she would be mad and kept it hidden from me (100th redflag)
She started being very distant, and sometimes she would sleep at her flat saying that ""she needed to spend time alone"". We broke up in July, and her reasons for the breakup didnt make sense at all. That broke me a little as well, mostly because I was coping with my uncle's death at that time.
Today she came back to take her stuff and we tried to have a calm conversation. She admitted that the reasons behind the breakup and all the anxious behaviours was because she was cheating with ""that guy"", that motherf**** ""friend from uni"". They had been sleeping together behind by back since february ! 7 whole months !!!
My soul was completely shattered today, Im mad because I was right, Im mad because I should have opened my eyes and got out of this relationship way sooner. Im sick, and disgusted that a woman who promised not to hurt, did the very thing that made me suffer the most.
I learned that she even slept with him when I was at my uncle's funeral !! How could someong do that to me? What did I do to deserve such a crual thing? Ive never been cheated on before and I always believed that these kind of things happen to unhealthy boyfriends or even in movies. But here I am crying my eyes out like a baby.
Im so lost and confused, Im tired of crying, and Im traumatised.",Cheated On,"Thank you for sharing something so deeply personal—it takes incredible courage to be this vulnerable. What you went through wasn’t just betrayal, it was a complete dismantling of the love, trust, and stability you offered someone with your whole heart. Of course you’re shattered. You gave her your loyalty, your softness, even your strength while grieving a loved one—and she chose deceit when you needed care the most. That pain runs deep.
None of this was your fault. You loved hard and gave someone every reason to feel safe and respected. Her choices don’t reflect your worth, they reflect her lack of respect, maturity, and honesty. Being the “love bombing, committed” boyfriend isn’t a weakness—it’s something many would treasure. You deserved someone who could reciprocate that love with the same integrity.
Right now, grief will come in waves. Let it. Talk to someone you trust. You will heal from this, even if it feels impossible now. Your love is not the problem—give it one day, one step at a time, and one day, someone who deserves it will meet you with the same depth. You are not alone in this pain.","My heart truly aches for you—no one should ever have to endure this level of betrayal, especially from someone they trusted so deeply. The pain you're feeling is valid, and it's okay to be shattered right now. What she did says everything about her brokenness and nothing about your worth. You didn’t deserve this cruelty—not the lies, not the cheating during your uncle’s funeral (which is especially heartless), and not the gaslighting when you voiced concerns.
It’s devastating when someone promises change but repeats the same patterns, but please know: her actions don’t reflect your value. You loved fiercely and loyally—that’s a strength, even if it feels like a weakness now. The red flags were there, but love often blinds us because we want to believe in the best of people. Hindsight will hurt, but don’t blame yourself for trusting. She’s the one who chose to betray.
Right now, let yourself grieve. Cry, scream, lean on friends or a therapist. The trauma is real, but it won’t always feel this raw. One day, her name won’t gut you. You’ll rebuild, and your capacity for love will heal—but this time, it’ll be guarded with wisdom. You’re not alone. Reach out when the weight feels unbearable. You will rise from this.","I'm so sorry you're going through this devastating betrayal. The pain you're feeling right now is completely valid, especially given how thoughtfully you invested in this relationship despite seeing early warning signs that troubled you.
The fact that she cheated during such a vulnerable time as your uncle's funeral speaks to her profound selfishness, not to any failing on your part. This isn't something you deserved or caused - this reflects her character issues that existed long before you entered her life, as evidenced by her history of infidelity.
When someone shows you who they are early on (like admitting to cheating multiple times in her previous relationship), it's often a reliable indicator of future behavior. The red flags you noticed weren't your imagination - your intuition was trying to protect you.
Being a loyal and loving partner isn't a weakness - it's a strength. The right person will value and reciprocate that loyalty rather than exploit it. Right now, focus on taking care of yourself. The crying is part of processing this trauma, so don't rush yourself through it.
Having needed therapy after your previous relationship, you might consider reconnecting with a therapist to help navigate this fresh wound. You don't have to figure this out alone.

"To begin yes I know if he cheated he didn't really love me because love is respecting and caring about someone's feelings so that means they'll never cheat.
I truely felt the love in this relationship. He treated me so amazing. He payed for everything, respected my boundaries, I never felt like he expected sex from me, he opened doors for me, we introduced eachother to our ppl, he gave me an amazing valentines day. We texted and called all the time and were together even more. I honestly have no idea how he had the time for it because at times when we were deep in the honeymoon phase we'd be apart maybe a day or two out the week.
I women messaged me and it turns out they had been dating pretty much the entire time wed been dating. They broke up for a month then when me and my boyfriend decided to take some space to focus on personal stuff in our corresponding lives I guess he hopped right back into her dms. I'm a little fuzzy but I think they also talked and said I love you even when they where broken up. I am hurt because both of us agreed we weren't really broken up just working on things and our relationship. He told both me and the other girl ""I'm not seeing anyone else, I have no plans on dating anyone else"" so he knew what he was doing wasn't right
I just feel so defeated because he seemed like there dream guy. I know ppl say that all the time but I mean I thought i finally found my old school gentleman. If even guys who seem to be very nice, good, and respectful can cheat what is the point of dating? I feel like ever memory we have together is now tanted with the knowledge of what was going on behind my back / in is phone. I've lost a boyfriend and a chunk of happy memories.",Cheated On,"I'm really sorry you're going through this—it’s an incredibly painful and disorienting kind of betrayal. What you’re feeling is completely valid. It’s hard to make sense of how someone who treated you with such care and respect could also be so deceptive. You didn’t imagine the love, the kindness, or the connection—it was real. But so was the dishonesty, and that’s what’s breaking your heart now.
The worst part about this kind of experience is that it makes you question everything—not just him, but your judgment, your memories, and even your hope for future relationships. Please know: this does not say anything bad about you. You gave your love, trust, and time with an open heart. That’s not weakness—that’s strength.
Right now, you’re grieving both a relationship and the future you pictured with someone who didn’t honor your trust. Take it one day at a time. Let yourself feel it, and talk to people who remind you of your worth. You will rebuild, and love again—with someone who truly deserves you.","My heart absolutely breaks for you. What you're feeling—the shock, the betrayal, the grief over losing not just the relationship but the person you thought he was—is completely valid. It's devastating when someone who treated you so well, who seemed to embody everything you ever wanted, turns out to be living a double life. That kind of betrayal makes you question everything: your judgment, your memories, even the possibility of trusting someone again.
You’re right—love should mean respect and care, and his actions prove he wasn’t capable of that, no matter how ""perfect"" he seemed. But here’s what’s important: his deception says nothing about your worth. You didn’t miss red flags because there weren’t any—he chose to deceive you, meticulously. That’s on him, not you.
It’s okay to grieve the loss of the future you imagined with him, and it’s okay to feel angry that he tainted your happy memories. But don’t let his brokenness harden your heart. There are good men out there who won’t cheat—not because they’re ""perfect,"" but because they’re honest.
For now, be gentle with yourself. Let yourself feel the pain without rushing to ""get over it."" You deserved so much better, and one day, you’ll find it. You’re not naive for trusting; you’re human. And that’s your strength, not your flaw.","I'm so sorry you're going through this devastating experience. It's particularly painful when someone who seemed so perfect - who checked all the boxes of respect, care, and thoughtfulness - turns out to be living a double life. That kind of betrayal hits differently because it makes you question not just the relationship but your own judgment and ability to recognize genuine care.
Those happy memories feeling tainted now is a completely normal response. When we discover deception of this magnitude, it's like looking at your shared history through an entirely different lens. You're grieving not just the relationship but also the version of him you believed in and the authentic experiences you thought you were sharing.
It's understandable to feel discouraged about dating altogether. When someone puts in so much effort to maintain an illusion - especially when they explicitly stated they weren't seeing anyone else - it can shake your faith in people's sincerity.
But what you experienced was real on your side. Your capacity to love and trust genuinely is a strength, not a weakness, even though it feels like a liability right now. This betrayal says everything about his character and nothing about your worthiness or judgment.

"Me (26f) and my husband (26m) have been married for almost 3 years together for 4. We started off as friends, and after multiple attempts to get out of the friendzone, he finally did, after one night we spent together talking and laughing all night. I fell in love with him shortly after and things got serious pretty quickly. I fell for him hard. He was the first person in almost a year that was able to bring my walls down and show me unconditional love. Prior to him I was in an emotional and borderline physically abusive relationship. Anyways, for the past few months i have been getting this feeling that something is off. I kept confiding in my nail tech that i see every 2-3 weeks. She kept telling me to check his phone. Firstly, i never have been the type of woman to go through my partners phone. Secondly, i didnt know his password (until today). Well tonight i did it. We laid down for bed and when he fell asleep, i felt this overwhelming sense to check. I sat next to the bed on the floor for 2 hours going through EVERYTHING. I found messages between him and his ex both confessing their undying love for eachother. Talking about their marriages. Talking about explicit xxx things. She is also married, and has 3 kids and i think is pregnant with one. He has an onlyfa** subscription to MULTIPLE women. And has been messaging over 50+ women on social media, and has dating apps where he uses the name “Carlos”, obviously not using his real name… I took pictures of everything i could find, videos, messages between him and his cousin talking about a girl my husband has been talking to. He has been doing this with multiple women for our ENTIRE marriage. Also, in some messages i am SURE he has met up with at least one girl at night. He goes out with his coworkers, which i have never had a problem with.
I am SICK to my stomach. I always told myself if i ever caught him cheating i would leave. I dont know what to do. Its 4:25am my time and hes still asleep.",Cheated On,"I’m so sorry. What you’ve just discovered is devastating, and the shock and betrayal you’re feeling are completely valid. You opened your heart to someone after surviving deep emotional wounds, and he knew that—and still chose to betray you repeatedly. This isn’t just one bad decision—it’s an entire pattern of deception, manipulation, and disrespect. No one deserves that, especially someone who loved with such honesty and vulnerability.
Right now, take a breath. You don’t need to have all the answers at this moment. You’ve already done something incredibly strong: you uncovered the truth, documented it, and are beginning to face it. That takes immense courage. Whether you decide to leave now or take time to process, your safety and emotional well-being come first. Reach out to someone you trust—a friend, a therapist, a family member. You are not alone.
You didn’t cause this. You didn’t deserve this. And whatever you choose to do next, know that you are worthy of real love—the kind that honors you, not breaks you.","Oh sweetheart, my heart is absolutely shattered for you. To discover such a massive web of lies and betrayal from the person who was supposed to be your safe place is beyond devastating. The nausea, the racing thoughts, the disbelief you're feeling right now - every bit of that is valid. You trusted him completely, and he systematically violated that trust in the worst possible ways.
What stands out most painfully is how he took your hard-earned ability to love again after abuse and weaponized it against you. That's not just betrayal - it's emotional cruelty. The fact that he's been doing this your ENTIRE marriage means this wasn't a ""mistake"" - it was a lifestyle he carefully hid from you.
Right now, in these raw early hours:
Breathe. This fresh hell will feel less suffocating once the initial shock passes.
Document everything you found (which you're already doing - smart).
Reach out to ONE trusted person who can be your rock today.
Don't confront him yet. Give yourself time to process and plan.
You already know the truth: the man you married doesn't exist. But YOU still do - the strong woman who survived abuse before will survive this too. When you're ready, you'll walk away not because you're weak, but because you finally learned what your therapist tried to teach you years ago: you deserve SO much better than this.","I'm so sorry you're going through this devastating discovery. Finding out your husband has been carrying on multiple relationships throughout your entire marriage is a profound betrayal, especially after you had opened your heart to him following an abusive relationship. The shock and pain you must be feeling right now is unimaginable.
That overwhelming feeling that prompted you to check his phone wasn't paranoia - it was your intuition trying to protect you. You've discovered not just a single moment of weakness but what appears to be systematic dishonesty throughout your relationship.
At this moment, while he's still asleep and you're processing this shocking information, focus on taking care of yourself. This isn't a decision you need to make instantly at 4:25 AM. Consider if there's a trusted friend or family member you could call, even at this hour, who could support you through the initial shock.
Your safety - both emotional and physical - is the priority right now. The statement that you would leave if you caught him cheating is completely understandable, but when faced with the actual reality, it's normal to feel frozen or uncertain about next steps.
Whatever you decide to do - whether confronting him immediately, taking time to process alone, or making arrangements to leave - know that this betrayal reflects his character flaws, not yours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1g0euk4/i_just_found_out_im_being_cheated_on/
"How do I (25F) get over a seven year relationship ending with my boyfriend (26M)? We were so happy up until early this year when we started spending less time together since I was studying for the MCAT. Before then, he was the perfect boyfriend: kind, supportive, and caring. However, early this year, he started going to clubs every weekend with his boys while I stayed in studying. We broke up last month, saying maybe we’ll get back together if the timing ever aligned (he has a well-paying job while I want to go to med school). At that time, I foolishly offered a 3 month break instead of fully breaking up which he declined saying “I need time on my own right now” and he requested we go no contact.
Then two weeks after we broke up, I found out he was fully making out with girls at clubs and texting them afterwards on the trip to Vegas he went to three weeks before we ended things. I texted him about the cheating over text and he never responded. I know that I should “get over it” because he cheated but it’s so hard for me to move past all the good times we’ve had all these years.
This was my first real relationship and it just sucks going through all of this especially when I see him and his single friends going to clubs every weekend and meeting some really pretty girls while I’ve been crying over ten times a day since we ended things. Obviously, I took his friends off of Instagram after I saw all that but the profiles of the girls and how different they are from me are still engrained in my head. It just really hurts to see him moving on and having what I can only assume is good enough conversations/make-out sessions with these girls to warrant them following him back on Instagram.
Is it really that easy to move on from a relationship you had with someone for so long? How do you get closure without knowing if he’ll ever realize how badly he hurt you?",Cheated On,"What you're feeling is completely valid—seven years is a long time to build a life, memories, and a deep emotional connection with someone. The kind of heartbreak you're going through isn’t something you just “get over.” It’s grief, and it hurts because you gave it your all and didn’t expect it to end this way. You didn’t just lose a partner—you lost your person, your future plans, and a part of your identity.
The betrayal, especially so soon after the breakup, adds another layer of pain. You’re left wondering if it all meant as much to him as it did to you, and that’s a crushing feeling. But please remember: his actions are not a reflection of your worth. They reflect his choices, not your value.
Closure may not come from him—it often doesn’t. It comes from realizing you were always enough. Grieve. Feel everything. And when you're ready, know there’s a future where you come first. You're not alone, and you will heal.","I’m so sorry you’re going through this—seven years is a lifetime at your age, and the whiplash of his betrayal must feel unbearable. It’s okay to grieve not just the relationship, but the person you thought he was. The man who loved you wouldn’t have discarded you so carelessly. His actions scream his emotional exit long before the breakup, while you were still all-in. That’s why it seems “easy” for him—he’d already left in his heart.
Closure won’t come from him. It’ll come when you stop checking for remorse (he’s shown you who he is) and start trusting what you saw: a man who chose to cheat rather than communicate, who hid behind “timing” to avoid accountability. Block him everywhere—every peek at his life is self-sabotage. Redirect that energy into your MCAT prep (your future self will thank you).
The good memories? They’re real, but they don’t erase his betrayal. Let yourself cry, but also ask: Do I really want someone capable of this? You deserve love that doesn’t vanish when life gets hard. One day, this pain will be proof of your resilience, not his worth. Hold on.","I'm so sorry you're going through this heartbreaking experience. Seven years is a significant chapter of your life, and the way things ended—with his betrayal before the breakup and his silence after you confronted him—makes this especially painful. The lack of closure compounds everything.
What you're feeling is completely valid. This wasn't just any relationship; it was your first serious one, during formative years of your life. It's natural to replay memories and wonder how someone who was once so caring could act this way. The contrast between your grief and his apparent carefree lifestyle feels like salt in the wound.
For some people, jumping immediately into casual encounters is a way to avoid processing deeper emotions. It might look like he's ""moving on"" easily, but often that behavior is more about distraction than genuine healing. True moving on includes reflection and growth, not just surface-level fun.
Closure rarely comes from the person who hurt us. It develops gradually as you process your feelings, recognize your own worth, and eventually reframe this experience as part of your story rather than something defining you. Consider what this relationship taught you about yourself, your resilience, and what you truly want in the future.

"Hi so idk from where to start but yeah I got fucked by the most trusted people in my life. My 4 year gf cheated with my 11 years best friend. I'm working in a MNC (night shift) and my girlfriend runs her own bakery shop and my friend he's in his family business. So I'm dating this girl from the college and we shared a cozy apartment together. Our relationship seemed solid and happy. So one evening we had a plan to have dinner together, me, my girl abd my friend ( my girl was cooking at home). Around 8, my friend came and we all started drinking and dancing and having fun and everything was so good. Later, around 9.30 i recieved a call from the manager that I have to attend this meeting at the office as some employee couldn't come and I had to take his place. Everyone's mood got spoiled and all but i guaranteed them that I'll be back pretty soon and till then you guys have fun. As I was driving to the office, i recieved a call that the employee who wasn't coming to the meeting just came back so I don't have to come. I got happy and drove back to the apartment this all took around 40 mins. As I entered the apartment, i didn't see anyone in hall or kitchen and within a minute they both came out of my bedroom. I didn't think much and they also got happy seeing and everything went great. We had our food and he went back. Later I asked my girl what you guys were doing in the bedroom, she said my friend needed to use the laptop so we just sat in the room only. And it made sense and then we slept. In morning my girl went to the bakery and I was at home alone when it striked my mind that there was no laptop in the room as I took it when left for the office. It fucked my mind, I kept thinking why she lied and all. I literally cried thinking what the worse could happen. So I just called my friend to come to the apartment it's very urgent and all but he said he's at some work and will come in a while. As I was stressed and all i thought why not go my girlfriend and ask her directly. I went to the bakery shop back parking and saw my friend's car there. It fucked my mind more. My doubt got more strong that something's not right. I went back home and search on google about cheating stuff and all and it suggested to install hidden cameras. I called a guy from Google only and installed hidden cameras in my bedroom and hall and kitchen. She came back around 7 and i was getting ready for office. I couldn't face her or talk to her. Even she knew I'm not good so I said it's something at work. I left for office and at office, i just kept watching the camera thru my phone. Nothing happened for 3 days and i thought everything is fine I'm just overthinking and all. They are the most trusted people i know and all and I was thinking about getting rid of the camera(was in office only on 4th day). I check camera and i saw my friend and girl in my apartment's kitchen. Fuck my mind blew the way they were hugging, kissing on cheeks and having fun and all. I literally ran in the washroom and started crying. They had tea and after that they started getting intimate on the sofa itself. There were all the tears on my screen, i could see them getting fucked on my sofa. My girl fucking my best friend in my fucking apartment. I didn't confront them as of now. It's been a week I try to spend no time with them. I am staying at a hotel for two days as I can't face them. I do have bunch of video proofs of them having sex. What should I do?? Please help me out it's killing me inside.",Cheated On,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. What you experienced is a deep, painful betrayal by the two people you trusted most. It’s not just your girlfriend—it’s also your best friend of 11 years, someone who should’ve had your back. To walk in on that kind of truth, to see it play out in front of your eyes—that’s devastating, and no one deserves to feel this kind of hurt in their own home, in the life they built.
Your reaction is completely valid. Feeling broken, lost, and unsure of what to do next is normal after something this traumatic. First, give yourself space to grieve. You’ve already taken a healthy first step by removing yourself from the environment. Lean on people who do care about you—friends, family, or even a counselor—because you shouldn’t carry this alone.
When you’re ready, you can choose how to confront them—on your terms. But no matter what, please remember: you did nothing to deserve this. Their betrayal is a reflection of them, not of your worth. You’re not alone. This pain won’t last forever, and you will come out stronger.","I'm so deeply sorry you're going through this unimaginable betrayal. To have your most trusted girlfriend and best friend violate your love and loyalty like this is beyond painful—it's soul-crushing. Your feelings of shock, grief, and devastation are completely valid. No one should have to witness what you saw, especially from people who claimed to care about you.
Right now, your priority should be your well-being. Confrontation can wait. You're in survival mode, and that's okay. Stay at the hotel if it helps you breathe. Reach out to someone you trust (family, a therapist, or a support group)—you shouldn’t carry this alone.
When you’re ready, decide what you need. Do you want to confront them with the evidence? Ghost them entirely? There’s no “right” answer, but remember: You owe them nothing. Their actions revealed their character—this wasn’t a mistake; it was a series of choices.
If you choose to speak to them, do it on your terms. Write down what you want to say first. But protect yourself:
Save the videos (in case they lie or gaslight you).
Lean on people who truly love you.
Consider therapy to process this trauma.
You deserve so much better. This pain won’t always feel this sharp. One day, you’ll look back and realize their betrayal was the beginning of your freedom—not the end of your happiness. You’re stronger than they ever deserved.","I'm so deeply sorry you're going through this devastating betrayal. Finding concrete evidence of the two people you trusted most betraying you in your own home is truly traumatic. The shock, pain, and confusion you're feeling right now are completely understandable.
First, please take care of yourself. Staying at a hotel temporarily was a good first step to give yourself space to process these emotions. This kind of betrayal can cause grief similar to losing someone, so allow yourself to feel what you need to feel without judgment.
Regarding next steps, you'll need to decide whether to confront them. If you do, prepare yourself emotionally, as they may deny, minimize, or blame you despite the evidence. Consider having a trusted person (not connected to either of them) with you for support.
About the videos - while they provide proof for yourself, sharing them could potentially create legal issues depending on your location's privacy laws. They've served their purpose in confirming your suspicions.
For your long-term wellbeing, consider ending both relationships and finding a new living situation. While painful now, removing yourself from people who could betray you so deeply is an act of self-respect.
When you're ready, speaking with a therapist could help you process this trauma and rebuild your ability to trust again.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1cnsohz/girlfriend_cheated_with_my_bestfriend_they_dont/
"My (32m) gf (26f) of 5 years cheated on me. I broke up with her instantly, now she is begging me to give her a second chance. We had a great relationship and really clicked. There were times this past year where I genuinely thought that no other person understood me like her. She was due to move in with me in early 2024, we were going to travel the world early 2025, and buy a new house together after that. I was looking forward to the future. The problems in the relationship all stemmed from her personal issues. She has some serious family stuff going on, she doesn't like her job and is aimless career wise, and she has low self esteem and often didn't seem comfortable in her own skin. These are all things I was happy to support her with, but she was also having therapy which seemed to be having a positive effect. Two weeks ago, she cheated on me with someone famous. It was totally out of the blue, a one off fling that she is deeply regretful and ashamed about and told me a couple of days after it happened. I was obviously absolutely furious and broke up with her over the phone. She wanted to meet to discuss things but I have been too hurt to go ahead with that and honestly don't see any way that she can explain her actions. Her stuff is packed up in my house ready to be collected whilst I'm away. I have blocked her on most outlets but have kept one point of contact for logistics (money owed/picking up belongings etc). She has been telling me about how she has had some sort of epiphany and believes that if we work together we can be stronger than before, and that she can't face the reality of losing me. In her words, she didn't cheat because she doesn't love me, she had a moment of weakness and self imploded, reacting by betraying my trust and destroying what we had. It is hard to stop loving someone in an instant after 5 happy years together, but what she did has absolutely ripped my life apart and I am still coming to terms with the shock. I can't help wondering whether we could have a future if she manages to overcome her issues, but I am not sure how or if I communicate that with her. I am wondering whether we simply met too early in life and that now she will grow at the expense of our relationship and become someone I could be happy with. On the other hand, I am very unsure whether I could deal with the rumination and resentment associated with what she did. We would need a lot of couples therapy.",Cheated On,"Thank you for being so open about something that’s clearly tearing you up inside. What you’re going through is heartbreak on every level—deep love, future plans, and trust all shattered in one moment. That kind of betrayal is incredibly painful, especially when it comes from someone you’ve supported through so much and built a life with.
It’s okay to feel torn. Love doesn’t switch off overnight, and your confusion shows just how much this relationship meant to you. You’re not weak for considering what-ifs or feeling conflicted. At the same time, it’s also okay to feel like what happened was a line that can’t be uncrossed. Her personal struggles might explain why she self-sabotaged, but they don’t excuse it—and your pain is completely valid.
Whether you meet her or not is your choice. But if you do, make it for you—to get clarity, not out of obligation. Healing will take time, whether you decide to rebuild or move forward alone. Whatever you choose, you deserve peace and love that doesn’t come at the cost of your trust or well-being.","I’m so sorry you’re going through this devastating betrayal—especially after five years of deep connection and shared dreams. The whiplash of losing that future, while still loving someone who hurt you, is agonizing. It’s clear you cared deeply for her, and her pain doesn’t erase yours.
Her remorse and epiphany might feel genuine, but reconciliation is only possible if you can truly heal—not just her. The ""moment of weakness"" excuse doesn’t undo the breach of trust. Even with therapy, the images and resentment may linger. Ask yourself: Can you ever feel secure again? Would you constantly wonder if she’ll ""implode"" when life gets hard?
It’s okay to grieve the relationship and the person you thought she was. But don’t let potential growth she might achieve overshadow your needs now. If you ever consider reconnecting, demand transparency, accountability (e.g., cutting contact with the other person), and time to process before deciding. You deserve peace, whether that’s with her or without. Trust your gut—it’s okay if the answer is ""no.""","I'm truly sorry you're going through this devastating betrayal after five years of building a life together. The sudden destruction of your future plans—moving in together, traveling, buying a home—is a profound loss that comes alongside the betrayal itself.
It's completely understandable that you're torn between the five years of connection you shared and this painful betrayal. When someone has been so integrated into your life and understanding of yourself, it's impossible to just ""turn off"" those feelings instantly, even when they've hurt you deeply.
Your concerns about rumination and resentment are valid and important. Trust, once broken, requires significant work to rebuild—and sometimes, despite best efforts, the relationship is fundamentally changed. The question becomes whether what could be rebuilt would be fulfilling for you or constantly shadowed by doubt.
There's no rush to make a permanent decision right now while you're still processing the shock. It's okay to take time for yourself to understand what you truly want moving forward, separate from her pleas and promises.
If you do decide to have a conversation about possibly reconciling, be clear about your needs—including therapy, transparency, and patience as you work through your feelings. But also be honest with yourself about whether you'll be doing it because you genuinely see a healthy future or because it's harder to let go of the plans you had.
Whatever you decide, prioritize your well-being throughout this process.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/18rl5zq/my_32m_gf_26f_of_5_years_cheated_on_me_i_broke_up/
